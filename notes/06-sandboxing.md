# Sandboxing

The original intent was to have bramble be rootless. I think this is still an admirable goal, but in the immediate term it conflicts with some security issues.

The module import and command running syntax will allow this:
```
bramble run github.com/maxmcd/unsafe/virus:inject
```
If bramble is going to have this level of flexibility it should be sandboxed by default.

Support docker as an option, would work only for linux or just for running things in docker.
